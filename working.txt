delivery system

users : admin , delivery person 
(main)

order info :
delivery address (array), client info - name , mobile phone - , product id 

schemas:

Order: {
  id,
  address,
  location: { lat, lng },
  items: [],
  name,
  phoneNo,
  status,           // better as an enum
  timestamps: true
}
Staff: {
  id,
  name,
  phoneNo,
  assignedOrderIds: [ObjectId],
  capacity,
  available,
  currentLocation: { lat, lng }
}
Warehouse: {
  id,
  location: { lat, lng },
  address
}
DeliveryHistory: {
  staffId,
  orderIds: [],
  route: [ { lat, lng, timestamp } ],
  completedAt
}
staff dashboard:
pick all orders then a map will open with best route , then after you click on deliver of particular product , if route gets changed it wont consider it , after all are delivered , best route to initial warehouse will be given to you, after you reach ware house new orders assigned to you will be shown 

Static Route Locking
If route gets blocked or traffic increases, not updating route may lead to delays or inefficiencies.

You are building a full-stack MERN web application for a logistics company to manage and optimize product deliveries from a central warehouse (godown) to customer addresses. The system supports delivery staff assignment using CVRP (Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem), live map-based route generation, and delivery flow (Pick → Deliver).

🎯 Core Functional Requirements
🧑‍💼 User Roles
Admin

View all orders and staff

Assign orders via CVRP optimization

View live locations and routes

Mark orders manually if needed

Delivery Person

Login to see assigned orders and route

Click “Pick” on each order to confirm pickup

Click “Deliver” to mark delivery complete

Once all orders are delivered, return to godown

🚚 Order System
Create and store new delivery orders with:

Customer name, phone

Address (Google Maps Autocomplete)

Product list

Demand (e.g. weight/volume)

Auto-geolocation using Google Geocoding

Order statuses: pending, assigned, picked, delivered

👷 Staff System
Register delivery staff with:

Name, phone, max delivery capacity


Availability status

Assign orders based on available capacity via CVRP

🔁 Order Assignment via CVRP
Run assignment using a Python-based CVRP solver

Uses google OR-Tools 

Reads unassigned orders and available staff from DB

Outputs JSON mapping staff to optimal order clusters

From Node.js backend, run CVRP as a script using child_process

Store assigned orders and render optimized Google Maps routes

🗺️ Map View (Admin + Staff)
Use Google Maps JavaScript SDK

Show:

Godown location

All delivery addresses

Assigned route per delivery person

Use Google Directions API to render ordered route

📍 Real-Time Delivery Flow
Delivery person logs in

Sees assigned route on map

Each order has:

📦 “Pick” button (marks order as picked)

✅ “Deliver” button (marks it as delivered)

When all are delivered, return route is shown to godown

Update staff status to available when all deliveries done after returning to godown

🧱 Technical Stack
Frontend (React + Tailwind)
React, TailwindCSS, Axios

Google Maps JavaScript SDK

React Router + Context/Redux for state

Admin dashboard with map, order panel, optimize button

Delivery staff dashboard with personal route and live actions

Backend (Node.js + Express)
Express API:

/orders, /staff, /assign, /deliver, /pick

/route/:staffId – get optimized route

/track/:staffId – optional GPS tracking

Run CVRP via Python (OR-Tools)

Use child_process for backend → Python integration

Database (MongoDB + Mongoose)
Order Schema

js

{
  name, phoneNo, demand,
  items: [String],
  address: { lat, lng, text },
  assignedTo: ObjectId (Staff),
  status: 'pending' | 'assigned' | 'picked' | 'delivered',
  timestamps: true
}
Staff Schema

js

{
  name, phoneNo,
  capacity,
  available: Boolean,
  assignedOrders: [ObjectId],
  location: { lat, lng },
  timestamps: true
}
